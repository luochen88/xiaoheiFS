## ⚠️ MANDATORY: Read Constitution First

**Before writing or modifying any code, you MUST read the project constitution:**

```
constitution.md
```

The constitution defines **non-negotiable principles** that govern all development:

1. **Validator-First Data Validation** - Use `go-playground/validator`, no manual validation in handlers
2. **Centralized Error Management** - All errors in `internal/domain/errors.go`, no inline `errors.New()`
3. **Strict Layer Separation** - Handlers → Services → Repositories, no SQL in handlers
4. **Dependency Injection** - All dependencies via interfaces/ports
5. **Test-Driven Development** - Tests alongside implementation
6. **Observability** - Structured logging with zerolog
7. **Simplicity & YAGNI** - No premature abstractions

**Non-compliance will be rejected in code review.**

## Frontend (supersedes the auto-generated stack lines above)

The auto-generated sections above are stale: they predate the web-tier
consolidation and still say "Ant Design Vue", and they list a `backend/ frontend/
tests/` layout that never mentioned `adminweb/`.

Current state:

- **`frontend/`** is the single web application — a history-mode SPA carrying the
  public site, auth pages, user console (`/console`), installer (`/install`) and
  the admin console (at the operator-configured `admin_path`). Built with npm; the
  backend serves it from `./static`.
- **UI standard is Element Plus via the Art Design Pro template**, not Ant Design
  Vue. Constitution v1.1.0 records this change.
  - Conventions (required reading before writing a page):
    `docs/frontend/adp-conventions.md`
  - Migration plan and rules: `docs/frontend/adp-migration-plan.md`
- **`adminweb/`** is a legacy second SPA being folded into `frontend/`. Do not
  build on it; it is deleted at the end of the migration.

While the migration is in flight, `frontend/src/pages`, `frontend/src/layouts` and
the Ant Design components at the top level of `frontend/src/components` are dead
code kept only as a porting reference. They are excluded from `tsconfig.json` and
no route points at them. New pages go in `frontend/src/views`.

Frontend commands (`frontend/package.json`) — note CONTRIBUTING.md's `npm test`
does not exist here; there is no frontend test runner yet:

```bash
npm run dev         # :5173, proxies /api, /admin/api, /sdk, /uploads to :8080
npm run typecheck   # vue-tsc --noEmit — must stay at zero errors
npm run lint        # eslint
npm run build       # vite build -> frontend/dist
```

Go note: the system `go` on this machine is 1.19; this project needs the 1.25
toolchain at `/usr/local/go/bin/go`.
